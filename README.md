## Description:
iMessage Whiteboard is an in-app iMessage extension for real-time collaboration on a virtual whiteboard. Users can enter their chat session, click on the iMessage Whiteboard extension, and begin to draw, add text, or add images to a whiteboard that updates in real-time. Whiteboards can be saved as PDFs as well.

## Project Components:
This project consists of client-side code written in Swift and a small server that saves history.

## Special Notes:
At the project's current state, only a basic UI is up and running. No functionality has been added yet. The next step is to allow users to draw on the board.
