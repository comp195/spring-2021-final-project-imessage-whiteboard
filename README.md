## Description:
iMessage Whiteboard is an in-app iMessage extension for real-time collaboration on a virtual whiteboard. Users can enter their chat session, click on the iMessage Whiteboard extension, and begin to draw, add text, or add images to a whiteboard that updates in real-time. Whiteboards can be saved as PDFs as well.

## Project Components:
This project consists of client-side code written in Swift and a small Python server that saves history.

## Special Notes:
As of March 21, the project's client side code allows users to draw lines and make text boxes, but doesn't yet send those to the server. The networking is set up on the server side, but not actually utilized yet. Also, the updated project plan shows that some elements have been labeled as "stretch goals" or moved to later dates to accommodate for some earlier goals that took longer than expected.
